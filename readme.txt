Group 6 - Rui Liu, Lingzhu Yu, Cui Liu, Jing Yang, Kwanchanok Sonsoi 

Leaderboard:

We add leaderboard in 2 places: homepage.php->score button, and leaderboard.php (after game over or all cleared division, players can submit their scores to database, and jump intoleaderboard.php to show the leaderboard table, and display the players' current rank).

1. Homepage.php: 
click the score button to show the first 15 players' scores

2. Leaderboard.php:
In game.html, when game over or all cleared, there will show a page for players to enter their name and submit their scores. If the players do not want to input their name, the server will set a default name "Guest" and submit the score.

The leaderboard.php will show the first 15 players'score rank table, and also the current players' rank number, score and name.

We implement all leaderboard function by using PHP and SQL.
